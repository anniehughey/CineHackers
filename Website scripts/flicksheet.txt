"Ernst Lubitsch's silent comedy from 1926 showed what a German emigre could teach Hollywood about sex! It stars the vivacious actresses Lilyan Tashman and Patsy Ruth Miller as pleasure-seekers whose attentions stray to each other's husband." (Film Forum) The film features a wild party that includes the first ever choreographed dance scene to appear in a film with partygoers doing, what else, the Charleston!

White Material (2009)
Mar 22
director: Claire Denis; cast: Isabelle Huppert, Christopher Lambert, Isaach De Bankole
The ever-provocative Claire Denis returns with a harrowing tale of French colonial Africa.

If you see only one French film this year, make it this.
