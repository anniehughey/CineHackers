			<p class="text">There are many parking options for Cornell Cinema screenings. We suggest the Willard Straight Lot, the Anabel Taylor Lot (some spots are unrestricted after 5pm — be sure to read the signs or you will be ticketed!), along South Avenue or Stewart Avenue, or the lot off Edgemoor Lane off West Avenue. Please note that some of these options do require walking uphill. Parking is also available at the Schoelkopf Parking Garage, where there is ample space and it is free after 5pm. It's a less than 10 minute walk to Willard Straight. Please pay close attention to all parking signs in case of any rule changes!</p>
