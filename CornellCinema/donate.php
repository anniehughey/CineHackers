			<h1 class="title">BECOME A FRIEND OF CORNELL CINEMA!</h1>
			<p class="text">Cornell Cinema celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2010, and for 4 decades, we managed to keep our projectors rolling with little assistance from individual donations. But with rapidly evolving technologies changing the ways films are released and experienced, we now critically need your help.<br> A donation from you, large or small, will help us continue to offer the wide variety and quality of films patrons have come to expect from Cornell Cinema, as well as present the increasingly important live events (visiting filmmakers, live music/film performances) that bring people into the theatre at a time when there are so many alternative ways to view a film on its own.<br> Please accept our invitation to become a Friend of Cornell Cinema by making a tax-deductible contribution. Unrestricted gifts, no matter what the amount, help support Cornell Cinema. Gifts may also be designated to support a specific area of our activities. We are happy to send you a list of particular needs and funding opportunities—simply email director Mary Fessenden at mkf2@cornell.edu for more information.</p>
