			<h1 class="title">Why Advertise at Cornell Cinema?</h1>
			<p class="text">
				During the academic year, Cornell Cinema typically presents 5 different films per week, ranging from classic, to foreign, to documentary, to arthouse. These are screened in repertory style five nights a week, Wednesday through Sunday—two shows on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—in the historic Willard Straight Theatre on Cornell University’s campus, for a total of 9 screenings per week. The variety of films shown attracts a wide demographic of undergraduate and graduate students, Cornell faculty and staff, and community members. Average attendance per screening is 60. This kind of exposure offers advertisers a unique opportunity.
			</p>
			<h1 class="title">Why On-Screen Advertising?</h1>
			<p class="text">
				Movie-goers are a captive audience for digital on-screen advertising, and studies have shown that recall of slides is 4 times more likely than that of newspapers and 3 times more likely than television. <br>
				Your on-screen ad will run at least twice for at least 10 seconds each in at least the 10 minutes before films screen in the Willard Straight Theatre.* This ensures your slide or short will come up while people take their seats before the movie begins.<br>
				The cost, especially for long-term advertising, is extremely reasonable for the amount of exposure you receive.<br>
				You are welcome to provide your own slide - or high resolution short commercial - which should measure 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels high and last no more than 15 seconds.
			</p>
