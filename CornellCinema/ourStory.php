			<h1 class="title">OUR STORY</h1>
			<p class="text">Cornell Cinema began in 1970 as a university film society, but has evolved into a media arts center with a national reputation. Cornell Cinema's primary purpose is to expose Ithaca and regional audiences to alternative forms of cinema (such as documentary, classic, and experimental films) as well as alternative voices not usually heard through the mass media. Its secondary purpose is to provide affordable, second-run commercial entertainment for the Cornell community. In fulfillment of its educational goals, Cornell Cinema encourages audiences to reflect critically on commercial and other media by supplementing its over 300 annual screenings with occasional faculty introductions, guest filmmakers, panel discussions, and more.</p>
			<p class="text">Cornell Cinema has been cited as one of the best campus film exhibition programs in the country, screening close to 150 different films/videos each year, five nights a week in the beautiful Willard Straight Theatre. Each calendar includes an array of classic Hollywood and foreign films, independent titles, documentaries, experimental work, recent international cinema, silent films with live musical accompaniment, cult classics and recent Hollywood and arthouse hits, in addition to guest appearances by visiting film and videomakers.</p>
			<p class="text">Cornell Cinema is a program of the Department of Performing and Media Arts, cosponsored by the Office of the Dean of Students. Cornell Cinema receives major support from the Undergraduate and Graduate and Professional Student Assemblies and public funds from the New York State Council on the Arts.</p>
			<h1 class="title">OUR INVOLVEMENT</h1>
			<p class="text">Over 150 films/videos are screened annually in series such as Classic Cinema, Doc Spots, Film Faves, Art Docs, Silent Films with Live Music, director and actor retrospectives, overviews of national and minority cinemas, and themed series.</p>
			<p class="text">

The festival features high-quality children's programs, including feature-length international films, animated and live-action short films and videos, experimental and documentary works for children, silent classics with live piano accompaniment, and special hands-on workshops with guest artists. Previous workshop guests have included children's filmmaker Michael Rubbo, animators John Canemaker and Stephanie Maxwell, and Toronto-based experimental filmmaker John Porter. </p>
