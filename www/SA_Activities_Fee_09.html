Read the guest column signed by past and current Daily Sun editors supporting Cornell Cinema in the Sun today: <a href="http://cornelldailysun.com/section/opinion/content/2009/11/01/defense-our-cinema">http://cornelldailysun.com/section/opinion/content/2009/11/01/defense-our-cinema<br />

Thursday, October 29:<br />


The Undergraduate Student Assembly passed the Appropriations Committee
recommendation to set Cornell Cinema's Activity Fee by-line funding at
$8.60, a $2.40 cut from the amount we currently receive. This decision
can be revisited at the final SA meeting of the semester.<br />


<br />


We have a petition in support of Cornell CInema receiving full funding at <a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/cornellcinemasaf">http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/cornellcinemasaf</a> <br />

Posted 10/27:<br />


As you may be aware, the Student Assembly is in the process of setting
the Student Activities Fee for 2010-2012. Last night Cornell Cinema met
with the Appropriations Committee, and this morning we received their
recommendation&nbsp; - a cut from the $11.75 we were requesting, and
the $11 we currently receive, to $8.60.<br />



<br />



<strong>This is a devastating reduction for our organization</strong>, and if approved will have far-reaching consequences. <em>We
will appeal the decision before the entire Student Assembly on
Thursday, which begins at 4:45 in the Willard Straight Memorial Room</em>.<br />



<br />



<em>Please show your support for Cornell Cinema by attending this meeting</em>,
and consider making a statement on our behalf if you are comfortable
doing so. If you are not able to attend, please let your Assembly
representative know your position (a list of members is at <a href="http://assembly.cornell.edu/SA/Members">http://assembly.cornell.edu/SA/Members</a>). <br />



<br />



We will post more information leading up to meeting.<br />



<br />



Thank you for your support!<br />
