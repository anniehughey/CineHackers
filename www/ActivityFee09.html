<p>The Undergraduate Student Assembly voted to grant Cornell Cinema an
allotment of $10/student for the next two years. Read about the Friday
meeting in the <a href="http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2009/12/05/facing-student-pressure-sa-restores-some-cinema%E2%80%99s-budget">Daily Sun Online.</a>&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://onecornell.com/">OneCornell</a> has been reporting on the Activity Fee controversy, with video clips! (Link fixed 12/14)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Friday, December 4:</p>


<p>Dear Cornell Cinema Supporters:<br />


<br />


<strong>The final meeting of the Undergraduate Student Assembly will
take place today from 4pm - 7pm, Friday December 4, in room 131 Warren
Hall.</strong> It is okay to come late. The business of the day is the
Student Activity Fee and any proposed amendments to the current
legislation.<br />


<br />


As you may be aware, Cornell Cinema applied for a slight increase in
funding this year from the Activity Fee, from $11/student to
$11.75/student, to help cover losses we incurred due to the recession.
The SA has instead proposed a 22% cut in out funding, to $8.60/student
- a nearly $32,000 cut.<br />


<br />


At last night's SA meeting, Cornell Cinema made a proposal: SA funding
at $11/student, on par with what we are receiving from the GPSA, which
will keep the ticket price the same for all students, and a promise
that we will spend the next two years seeking ways to divest ourselves
from Activity Fee funding, so that in the next cycle of funding we will
request less than $11/student.<br />


<br />


We do not know if this proposal will be introduced as an amendment, or what support for it exists on the Student Assembly. <br />


<br />


<strong>Please come to the meeting today and support Cornell Cinema!</strong>
There will be opportunities for community members to speak in support
of Cornell Cinema, so if you can, come prepared to make a statement (up
to 2 minutes). <em><strong>It is very important the SA hears your voices and sees your support!</strong></em><br />


</p>


<p></p>


<p>On Monday, November 16, the GPSA decided to not fund Cornell
Cinema at our requested $11.75, or at their $11.30 recommendation, but
at $11.05. The other $.25 went to Slope Day. Read the Daily Sun article

Activity Fee; the second half of the article focuses on Cornell
Cinema.&nbsp;</p>

The GPSA is conducting a <a href="http://gpsaatcornell.wordpress.com/2009/10/26/gpsa-fall-2009-survey/">survey</a>
about
the Activity Fee. Grad Students should fill it out. We encourage you to
answer the question "Do you think an increase of $0.30 is reasonable?"
NO and write in the comment line that you support fully funding Cornell
Cinema at $11.75. <br />

Thursday, October 29:<br />




The Undergraduate Student Assembly passed the Appropriations Committee
recommendation to set Cornell Cinema's Activity Fee by-line funding at
$8.60, a $2.40 cut from the amount we currently receive. This decision
can be revisited at the final SA meeting of the semester.<br />




<br />




We have a petition in support of Cornell CInema receiving full funding
at <a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/cornellcinemasaf">http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/cornellcinemasaf</a>
<br />




<br />




<br />




Posted 10/27:<br />




As you may be aware, the Student Assembly is in the process of setting
the Student Activities Fee for 2010-2012. Last night Cornell Cinema met
with the Appropriations Committee, and this morning we received their
recommendation&nbsp; - a cut from the $11.75 we were requesting,
and
the $11 we currently receive, to $8.60.<br />




<br />




<strong>This is a devastating reduction for our organization</strong>,
and if approved will have far-reaching consequences. <em>We
will appeal the decision before the entire Student Assembly on
Thursday, which begins at 4:45 in the Willard Straight Memorial Room</em>.<br />




<br />




<em>Please show your support for Cornell Cinema by attending this
meeting</em>,
and consider making a statement on our behalf if you are comfortable
doing so. If you are not able to attend, please let your Assembly
representative know your position (a list of members is at <a href="http://assembly.cornell.edu/SA/Members">http://assembly.cornell.edu/SA/Members</a>).
<br />




<br />




We will post more information leading up to meeting.<br />




<br />




Thank you for your support!<br />
