<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Jared Landsman<br />
</span></span>Hello, my name is Jared Landsman and I am running for
Secretary of the Cornell Cinema Advisory Board.&nbsp; Currently, I am a
freshman in the school of engineering.&nbsp; I have had a passion for
film all my life and my favorite childhood memories include going to
see movies on the big screen.&nbsp; I was actually exposed to the world
of film and television at a very early age due to my father&#8217;s
profession in the industry.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I believe I am the perfect candidate for Secretary of the Advisory
Board.&nbsp; In addition to my experience with film during my
childhood, I am extremely organized and keep everything in an orderly
manner, whether it is my daily work schedule or plans for a special
event.&nbsp; I am very familiar with managing and leading large groups
of people.&nbsp; For example, I directed a weeklong summer camp as well
as a highschool chapter of Engineers without Borders.&nbsp;
Additionally, I have become adept at social networking and maintaining
good communication between colleagues and friends.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Thank you very much and please vote for me, Jared Landsman, for your Secretary.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
<br />James Rowe<br />
</span></span>Hello everyone! &nbsp;My name is James Rowe. &nbsp;I am a
Junior Economics major, and I am running for the
Cornell&nbsp;Cinema&nbsp;Advisory Board Secretary. &nbsp;While I do not
have much experience with the Cornell&nbsp;Cinema&nbsp;Advisory Board,
having only joined this semester, I have really enjoyed what
the&nbsp;Cinema&nbsp;has to offer, and what the Advisory Board does to
ensure that the Cornell Community has a good way to relax and
enjoy&nbsp;cinema&nbsp;on a regular basis. &nbsp;As Secretary, I would
put in the time and effort to ensure that the
Cornell&nbsp;Cinema&nbsp;remains successful, and hopefully make it even
more successful in the future. &nbsp;I am a very organized person, and
I believe that as Secretary, I would best be able to communicate notes
and decisions made by the Advisory Board to our members, as well as
assisting with the organization of projects and any communication that
needs to be done to ensure their success. &nbsp;I ask you for your
vote, and I hope that we can make next year even more successful for
the Cornell&nbsp;Cinema&nbsp;than this year!<br />
